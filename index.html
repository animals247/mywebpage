<p>Plants
  at the end of this you will be an espert at plants and knoe exactly what plants to get
  There are loads of diffrent type of plants, most of them need watering about once a week.
  if you are starting off, your first plants should be... </P>
  <ul>
  <li> a cacti
   <li> a spider plant   
   <li> a peace lily
    </ul>
  <p> these are good for begginers because,
    cacti do not need much watering,
    Spider plants can live for long peiods of time,
    and peace lilys droop when they need watering.
